Women in Cybersecurity
About
Women in Cyber Security (WiCyS) – Established 2013
WiCyS was founded to create a collaborative platform for women from diverse academic backgrounds to come together, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. As cybersecurity continues to grow rapidly, the representation of women in the field remains significantly low. WiCyS aims to bridge this gap by attracting women from various fields, equipping them with the knowledge, resources, and networking opportunities essential for thriving in the cybersecurity industry.

WiCyS UH Chapter – Established 2018
Continuing the mission of the national organization, the University of Houston Chapter was founded to serve as a support system not only for female students pursuing cybersecurity but also for those interested in transitioning into the field from other disciplines. Our vision is to guide UH students in gaining deeper insights into cybersecurity, showcasing the numerous career opportunities available. We foster close connections with the industry through engaging workshops, informative sessions, seminars, and conferences, providing valuable exposure and real-world experiences.
